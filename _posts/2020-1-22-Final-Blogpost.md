For my final Machine Learning project, I contributed to the open-source repository scikit-learn. Specifically, I edited the docs of the \_validation module (located under model_selection). The validation module is focused on cross-validation, permutations, and learning curves. I added default values, took away all 'optional' tags, changed _boolean_ to _bool_ and _integer_ to _int_, and added shapes to X and y parameters. To do so, I first downloaded the development version of scikit-learn. Then, I made changes according to the doc guidelines that I read online. I made my first PR (pull request) and 2 very kind gentlemen gave me suggestions on how to improve my code. After following their advice, my commits were merged into the scikit-learn repository on Jan. 23, 2020. I hope my contributions will improve the clarity of scikit-learn's documentation so that more people can understand machine learning. <br><br>

Here is a picture of the actual scikit-learn repository, in which you can see that my PR was merged:<br><br>

The main goal of the Rollercoaster Project was to rank 300 rollercoasters based on several attributes (length, height, speed, and inversions for example). The data were first cleaned, and then scatterplots were created to compare different attributes. When appropriate, regressions were added to the graphs. Using this information, attributes were weighted in order to create the ranking. The top ten roller coasters were as follows:<\n\t>
	1) Steel Vengeance<\n>
	2) Fury 325<\n>
	3) El Toro<\n>
	4) Lightning Rod<\n>
	5) Millennium Force<\n>
	6) Twisted Colossus<\n>
	7) Voyage<\n>
	8) Iron Rattler<\n>
	9) Maverick<\n>
	10) Leviathan<\n>
